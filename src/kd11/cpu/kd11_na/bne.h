// BNE - branch if not equal (to zero)
//
// Operation:
//  PC <- PC + (2 * offset) if Z = 0
//
// Tests the state of the Z-bit and causes a branch if the Z-bit is clear.
// BNE is the complementary operation to BEQ. It is used to test inequality
// following a CMP, to test that some bits set in the destination were also
// in the source, following a BIT, and generally, to test that the result of
// the previous operation was not zero.
