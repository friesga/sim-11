// BNE is the complementary operation to BEQ. It is used to test inequality

// the previous operation was not zero.

// will always branch following an operation that added two negative numbers,
// even if overflow occurred. In particular, BLT will always cause a branch if
// it follows a CMP instruction operating on a negative source and a positive
// destination (even if overflow occurred). Further. BLT will never cause a
// branch when it follows a CMP instruction operating on a positive source and
// negative destination. BLT will not cause a branch if the result of the
// previous operation was zero (without overflow).
