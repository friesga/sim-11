// In general, when the user is specifying an address or data, OOT will use

// full 16-bit word is displayed. (Microcomputer and Memories Chapter 7)

// This is also the behaviour of the KDJ11-A processor. The KDJ11-B and
// KDJ11-E behave differently however: "If an odd address is entered, console
// ODT responds to the error by printing ?<CR><LF> or @".
