// Relocation expands the 18-bit Unibus address to the 22-bit main memory
// address. This allows the Unibus to access any location in main memory.
// This relocation or mapping of addresses is done by adding the contents
// of one of the mapping registers to bits (12:01) of the incoming Unibus
// address.
//
// All mapping registers in the Unibus map are 21 bits wide. A 22nd bit, which
// is not writable and is always read as zero, acts as the lowest-order bit
// for each register. Each register specifies the 22-bit base physical address
// of a 4K page residing on any word boundary in memory. The reason for using
// word boundaries is that the mapping logic does not recognize if a byte
// operation is being executed.
//
// Bits (17: 13) of the 18-bit Unibus address select a map register. The
// remaining bits (12:00) of the Unibus address are used as an offset into
// the page to which the mapping register is pointing. When an address is
// taken from the Unibus, the mapping register is automatically selected and
// the contents read out. Then the 22-bit base address contained in the
// selected map register is added to the 12-bit offset in the Unibus address
// to form the physical address. (EK-11024-TM-003)
//
// Bit 0 of the low mapping register is ignored as Qbus::writeWord() and
// Qbus::read() prevent writes to and reads from odd addresses.
// 
// It should be noted that the last mapping register (addresses 017770374 and
// 017770376) can be read or written, but cannot be used to map Unibus
// addresses because it would be used by addresses in the range of the
// I/O page (017760000 - 017777777).
//
// Diagnostic KKUAE0 test 5 confirms that 22-bit addresses with the highest
// four bits set and with Unibus Map disabled have to be transformed to their
// 18-bit equivalent (i.e. the highest for bits have to be masked off).
