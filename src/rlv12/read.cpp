            The DRDY signal is sent by the selected drive to indicate that it
            is ready to read or write or seek.  It is sent when the heads are
            not moving and are locked onto a cylinder.  This is continuously
            monitored by the drive and controller. [EK-0RL11-TD-001, p. 3-8]
            Use the DS bits to determine if the drive has any outstanding I/O
            operations and set DRDY as appropriate.

            This seems to imply that only a Seek operation (not Read/Write)
            causes ready to be false.
