// This function determines the Drive Ready and Drive Status bits from
// the given unit and combines these bits with the current CSR to a 
// value to be returned to the caller. In case Drive Error is set,
// Composite Error is also set.
// 
// The DRDY signal_ is sent by the selected drive to indicate that
// it is ready to read or write or seek.  It is sent when the
// heads are not moving and are locked onto a cylinder.  This is
// continuously monitored by the drive and controller.
// (EK-0RL11-TD-001, p. 3-8)
//
// DR RDY will be negated [i.e. cleared] when a drive error
// occurs except when an attempt has been made to write on a
// write-protected drive or if volume check is set. In either
// case, only DR ERR will be asserted. (EK-RLV12-TD-001, p3-7)
// 
// This means that on a write to a write-protected drive or if
// volume check is set, DR ERR is set and DR RDY is cleared.
//
// The Drive Ready (and Drive Error) bits are taken over from the
// currently selected drive.
