// On the Unibus and QBus reads are always word-sized (and from an even
// address) and writes may be either word or byte sized (with byte-sized
// writes using the upper or lower byte depending on whether the address
// is odd or even). When the CPU needs a byte it reads a word and ignores
// the portion of the word it isn't interested in.
