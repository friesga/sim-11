// buffered. It comprises two registers, a holding register which receives
// characters from the processor and a shift register from which the characters
// are sent over the serial line. On receipt of a character in the holding
// register XMIT_READY is cleared, the character is transferred to the shift
// register, after which XMIT_READY is set again as the holding register is
// ready to accept another register. On receipt of a second character while
// the shift register is not yet empty XMIT_READY is cleared and not set
// until the shift register is empty and the character can be moved to that
// register. This implies that the first received character can be processed
// immediately but a time delay is present on receipt of a second character
// while the first character is being processed. See EK-DLV11J-UG-001
