// CMP - compare source to destination
//
// Operation:
//  (src)=(dst)
//
// Condition Codes:
//  N: set if result <0; cleared otherwise
//  Z: set if result = 0; cleared otherwise
//  V: set if there was arithmetic overflow; that is. operands were of
//     opposite signs and the sign of the destination was the same as the
//     sign of the result: cleared otherwise
//  C: cleared if there was a carry from the most significant bit of the
//     result; set otherwise
//
// Compares the source and destination operands and sets the condition codes,
// which may then be used for arithmetic and logical conditional branches.
// Both operands are unaffected. The only action is to set the condition codes.
