// JMP - jump
//
// Operation:
//  PC <- (dst)
//
// JMP provides more flexible program branching than provided with the branch
// instructions. Control may be transferred to any location in memory (no
// range limitation) and can be accomplished with the full flexibility of the
// addressing modes, with the exception of register mode 0. Execution of a
// jump with mode 0 will cause an "illegal instruction" condition, and will
// cause the CPU to trap to vector address 4. (Program control cannot be
// transferred to a register.) Register deferred mode is legal and will cause
// program control to be transferred to the address held in the specified
// register. Note that instructions are word data and must therefore be
// fetched from an even-numbered address.
