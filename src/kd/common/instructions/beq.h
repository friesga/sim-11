// BEQ - branch if queal (to zero)
//
// Operation:
//  PC <- PC + (2 * offset) if Z = 1
// 
// Tests the state of the Z·bit and causes a branch if Z is set. As an
// example, it is used to test equality following a CMP operation, to test
// that no bits set in the destination were also set in the source following
// a BIT operation, and generally, to test that the result of the previous
// operation was zero.
