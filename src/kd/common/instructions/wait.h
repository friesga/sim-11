// WAIT - wait for interrupt
//
// Condition Codes: not affected
//
// Provides a way for the processor to relinquish use of the bus while it
// waits for an external interrupt request. Having been given a WAIT command,
// the processor will not compete for bus use by fetching instructions or
// operands from memory.
//
// In WAIT, as in all instructions, the PC points to the next instruction
// following the WAIT instruction. Thus when an interrupt causes the PC and PS
// to be pushed onto the processor stack, the address of the next instruction
// following the WAIT is saved. The exit from the interrupt routine (i.e.
// execution of an RTI instruction) will cause resumption of the interrupted
// process at the instruction following the WAIT.
