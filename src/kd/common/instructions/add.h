// ADD - add source to destination
//
// Operation:
//  (dst) <- (src) + (dst)
//
// Condition Codes:
//  N: set if result <0; cleared otherwise
//  Z: set if result = O; cleared otherwise
//  V: set if there was arithmetic overflow as a result of the operation;
//     that is both operands were of the same sign and the result was of the
//     opposite sign; cleared otherwise
//  C: set if there was a carry from the most significant bit of the result;
//     cleared otherwise
//
// Adds the source operand to the destinatign operand and stores the result at
// the destination address. The original contents of the destination are lost.
// The contents of the source are not affected. Two's complement addition is
// performed.
