// power-up modes can be selected:
// 1. Trap to location 24/26,
// 2. Place the processor in ODT mode,
// 3. Start the system at the boot address.
// 
// These modes can be selected in the KD11_NA section of the configuration file.
// See Table 11-4 (Console Power-Up Printout (or Display) in the LSI-11,
// PDP-11/03 user's manual (EK-LSI11-TM-003) for the expected reaction on
// power-up.
//
// During the power-up sequence, the processor asserts BINIT L in response to
// a passive (low) power supply-generated BDCOK H signal. When BDCOK H goes
// active (high), the processor terminates BINIT L and the jumper-selected
// power-up sequence is executed. (EK-LSI11-TM-003)
//
// The function will return the state to transition to.
