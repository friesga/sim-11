// Perform a CPU step. The step mainly comprises three actions:
// 1. Execution of an instruction,
// 2. Handle the trace bit,
// 3. Handling of traps and interrupts that might have arisen during execution
//    of the instruction, either a trap as a result of an instruction, or an
//    interrupt requested by a bus device.
// 
// The cpu always is in of the following states:
// - HALT: the CPU is halted and cannot execute the step, return false,
// - RUN: the CPU will execute the next instruction,
// - WAIT: the CPU is running but is still waiting for an interrupt, return true.
// 
// As the power-up mode can be set to trap to the vector at address 024, the
// presence of traps is checked before an instruction is executed.
//
// The normal instruction flow can be interrupted by the setting of the BHALT
// or RESET bus signal. These signals are handled in their corresponding KD11_NA
// receivers which then calls a KD11_NA_Cpu control function.
//
// This function will return true if the CPU is in the state RUN and another
// instruction can be executed, false otherwise. In the latter case a HALT
// instruction was executed.
